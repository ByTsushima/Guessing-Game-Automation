# This program is intended to automate a guessing game involving an ATM machine. The aim of the game is to guess a 4-digit number. When a user enters a number, they will receive feedback from the ATM indicating whether their number is too high, too low, or if it is the correct one.

# The program will automate the user input in order to improve the efficiency of the game. It will use a binary search algorithm to iteratively guess numbers in the range of 0 and 1000000. With each guess, it will receive feedback on whether to go up, down, or if the current number is correct.

# In addition, the program will also allow the user to restore a previously guessed number using the left arrow key. This will provide the user with the added benefit of being able to explore the guessing process rather than having to start all over again each time.
